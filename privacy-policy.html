    <h1>Privacy Policy for Lens</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 4, 2024</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Lens ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains
        how our screen recording application handles your information.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We DO NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Lens is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information
        or user data. Specifically:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect your name, email address, or any personal identifiers</li>
        <li>We do not track your usage or behavior</li>
        <li>We do not use analytics or tracking tools</li>
        <li>We do not share any data with third parties</li>
        <li>We do not store your recordings on our servers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        All data in Lens is stored locally on your device:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Screen Recordings:</strong> All recordings are saved directly to your Mac in the location you choose</li>
        <li><strong>App Settings:</strong> Your preferences and settings are stored locally on your device using macOS's standard storage</li>
        <li><strong>Credits:</strong> Your credit balance is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to us</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        Lens requires certain macOS permissions to function:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Screen Recording:</strong> To capture your screen content</li>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To record webcam overlay (only if you enable this feature)</li>
        <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> To record audio (only if you enable this feature)</li>
        <li><strong>File Access:</strong> To save recordings to your chosen location</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These permissions are only used locally on your device. No captured content is ever transmitted off your device.
    </p>

    <h2>5. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>
        Lens offers in-app purchases for credits and subscriptions. All payment processing is handled securely
        by Apple through the App Store. We do not have access to your payment information. Apple's privacy
        policy governs the handling of payment data.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Lens does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The only
        third-party service used is Apple's StoreKit for in-app purchases, which is subject to Apple's privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since all data remains on your device and we do not collect or transmit user data, the security of
        your information is primarily dependent on your device's security settings and macOS security features.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Lens does not collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The app
        can be used by individuals of all ages as no personal information is collected.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with
        an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no data for us to provide, modify, or delete.
        All app data is stored locally on your device and can be managed through your device's settings or
        by uninstalling the app.
    </p>
